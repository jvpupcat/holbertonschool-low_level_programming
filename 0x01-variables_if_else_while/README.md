# 0x01 C - Variables, if, else, while

## Overview & If Statement

In this project, we will cover if, else, and the while loop. The if, else, and while loop are conditional statements that dictate the order in which a program runs. The ability to control the flow of the program, letting it make decisions is valuable to the programmer. An if statement is important function because it allows the program to select an action based upon the user's input.

When using an if statement, there are two meanings worth noting: TRUE and FALSE. A true statement is one that evaluates to a nonzero number. A false statement evaluates to zero. Another thing to look for is the use of ELSE and ELSE IF. Sometimes, a programmer will want to execute some code while a condition is false or if there are multiple values. The use of ELSE allows code to execute should a condition be false. The use of ELSE IF allows a programmer to set multiple conditions that may all evaluate to true and it can also be used to ensure that only one block of code is executed.

To make comparisons, a programmer must use arithmetic, relational, and logical operators. Operators are a set of symbols, similar to what you see in math, to make comparisons. Below are a list of operators (info provided by tutorialspoint):

| Arithmetic Operator | Description | Example
| --- | --- | --- |
| + |<p>Adds 2 variables.</p>|<p>x + y = 10</p>|
| - |<p>Subtracts 2 variables.</p>|<p>x - y = 9</p>|
| * |<p>Multiplies 2 variables.</p>|<p>x * y = 30</p>|
| / |<p>Divides numerator by de-numerator.</p>|<p>x / y = 4</p>|
| % |<p>Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer.</p>|<p>x % y = 0</p>|
| ++ |<p>Increment operator increases integer value by one.</p>|<p>x++ = 2</p>|
| -- |<p>Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one.</p>|<p>x-- = 1</p>|

| Relational Operator | Description | Example
| --- | --- | --- |
| == |<p>Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true.</p>|<p>(A == B) is not true.</p>|
| != |<p>Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.</p>|<p>(A != B) is true.</p>|
| > |<p>Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.</p>|<p>(A > B) is not true.</p>|
| < |<p>Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.</p>|<p>(A < B) is true.</p>|
| >= |<p>Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.</p>|<p>(A >= B) is not true.</p>|
| <= |<p>Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.</p>|<p>(A <= B) is true.</p>|

| Logical Operator | Description | Example
| --- | --- | --- |
| && |<p>Called an 'AND' operator. If both conditions are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.</p>|<p>(A && B) is false.</p>|
| || |<p>Called an 'OR' operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then the condition becomes true.</p>|<p>(A || B) is true.</p>|
| ! |<p>Called a 'NOT' operator. It reverses the logical state a condition. If a condition is true, then using ! will make it false.</p>|<p>while (!TRUE) is false.</p>|

## While Loop

A while loop repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body. There are a couple of control statements that can be used to control a loop. A break statement terminates the loop. If a break statement is used in a function where multiple functions are available, it'll break out of that function and move onto the next set of instructions. If there are no other instructions, the loop simply stops or breaks.

A continue statement causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating. A goto statement transfers control.
