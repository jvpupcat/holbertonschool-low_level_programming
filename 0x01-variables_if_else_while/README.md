## Overview

In this project, we will cover if, else, and the while loop. The if, else, and while loop are conditional statements that dictate the order in which a program runs. The ability to control the flow of the program, letting it make decisions is valuable to the programmer. An if statement is important function because it allows the program to select an action based upon the user's input.

When using an if statement, there are two meanings worth noting: TRUE and FALSE. A true statement is one that evaluates to a nonzero number. A false statement evaluates to zero. To make comparisons, a programmer must use relational operators. Relational operators are a set of symbols, similar to what you see in math, to make comparisons.

Below are a list of relational operators:

| Operator | Description | Example
| --- | --- | --- |
| == |<p>Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true.</p>|<p>(A == B) is not true.</p>|
| != |<p>Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.</p>|<p>(A != B) is true.</p>|
| |<p></p>|<p></p>|
| |<p></p>|<p></p>|
| |<p></p>|<p></p>|
| |<p></p>|<p></p>|
