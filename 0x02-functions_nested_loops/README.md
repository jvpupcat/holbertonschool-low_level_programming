#0x02 C Functions, Nested Loops

## Descriptions
A function is a group of statements that, together, perform a task. An example of a function
is main(), and all other programs can define additional functions. Instead of having everything
in one main() function, other functions can be broken up into smaller ones.

To define a function, it must consist of a function header and body. The following are the
parts that make up a function:
	* Return type - A function may return a value
	* Function name - The name of the actual function should be easy to identify when needed
	* Parameters - A parameter is like a placeholder. Parameters are optional
	* Function body - The function body contains a collection of statements that define
			what the function does

When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. The
called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed, it returns
the program control back to the main() program.

The function prototype serves the following purpose:
	* It tells the return type of the data that the function will return
	* It tells the number of arguments passed to the function
	* It tells the data types of each of the passed arguments
	* It tells the order in which the arguments are passed to the function

Nested loops are exactly what it sounds like. It is a loop within a loop. The first pass of the
outer loop triggers the inner loop, which executes to completion. The second pass of the outer
loop triggers the inner loop again. This repeats until the out loop finishes. A break within the
inner or outer loop would interrupt this process.

A nested loop is a logical structure used in computer programming and coding. It is a powerful
construct in programming that allows rapid sorting or insertion of large amounts of data in an
efficient way.
