## Overview of Hash Tables

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. The values returned are called any of the following: hash values, hash codes, digests, or hashes. Hash Tables are widely used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file. 

They are useful in cryptography.
