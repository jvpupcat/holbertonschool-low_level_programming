# 0x00 Hello World

<img src="https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/hello-world-program_0.jpg">

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to introduce the beginning of the C language. The answers in this repo are from exercises from Holberton School. The assignment name is called "Hello World!" because there is a long-standing tradition of programming the phrase when people are new to a language. It is often used to introduce novice programmers to a programming langauge.

The "Hello World!" program is also traditionally used in sanity tests to ensure that a computer language is installed correctly and that the operating system knows how to use it.

## What should be learned from this project

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Why C programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #cisfun :))
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type gcc main.c
- What is an entry point
- What is main
- How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
- How to compile using gcc
- What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
- What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the main function influence the return value of the program

## Requirements for C

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc 4.8.4
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use system
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

## Requirements for shell scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
